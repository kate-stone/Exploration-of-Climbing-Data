# Exploration of Climbing Data

Rock climbing is a physically demanding and mentally challenging sport that continues to grow in popularity year on year. Presently, the number of participants is estimated at [44.5 million](https://www.ifsc-climbing.org/index.php/about-us/key-figures) world wide. 

To accomplish the ultimate goal of 'sending' the route, climbers have to engage a variety of muscles, employ specialty techniques, and exercise control over their minds. It is an exciting and challenging sport, and, as an avid climber myself, I completely understand the appeal. 

The way many users measure their progress in the sport is by recording the routes they've climbed in an online climbing logbook. Popular platforms offering this service include theCrag, Mountain Project and UKC Logbook. Arguably the most popular and well known platform though is 8a.nu. 

The objective of this project is to explore user logged data from 8a.nu to attempt to answer a few questions about the sport of climbing. These include:
- How much do physical attibutes such as weight and height influence climbing ability?
- How do older climbers fair compared to younger climbers?
- How long does it take to climb at an impressive level?

The data was scraped from 8a.nu on 13-Sep-2017 and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dcohen21/8anu-climbing-logbook). Unfortunately, the scraper is not available on [Github](https://github.com/dcohen21/8a.nu-Scraper) anymore due to DMCA takedown.
